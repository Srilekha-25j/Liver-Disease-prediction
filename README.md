# Liver-Disease-prediction


# Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of liver disease in patients using machine learning techniques. Liver disease is a significant health concern worldwide, and early detection can greatly improve treatment outcomes. By leveraging data science and predictive modeling, this project seeks to assist healthcare professionals in identifying patients at risk of liver disease.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from [provide dataset source/link]. It contains various clinical features such as age, gender, blood test results, and other relevant indicators associated with liver health. The dataset is preprocessed and cleaned to ensure accurate analysis and model training.

The dataset used for this task was gotten from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/indian-liver-patient-records

# Methodology
The project follows a typical machine learning pipeline:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the dataset to gain insights into the distribution of features and their relationships with the target variable.
Feature Engineering: Selecting or creating relevant features that can improve model performance.
Model Selection: Experimenting with different machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, random forest, support vector machines, etc.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of each model using appropriate evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuning the parameters of selected models to optimize performance.
Validation and Testing: Validating the final model on a separate test set to ensure generalization to unseen data.
Results
The predictive models developed in this project demonstrate promising performance in identifying individuals at risk of liver disease. Detailed results including model accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics are presented in [provide link to results file or notebook].
